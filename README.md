Llamame was a collaborative project between back-end engineering students at The Iron Yard. Our team of five worked together to produce a fictitious customer relationship management tool for Llama farmers.   

During the build-out, we learned how to best work in an open source workflow with a team by enlisting the use of pull requests, continuous integration, and agile methodologies.
